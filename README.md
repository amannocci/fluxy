# Fluxy

__Currently not stable and under heavy development!__

*Fluxy is a tool to manage events. You can for example use it to collect logs, parse them, and store them for later use.
It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache-2.0, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.*
